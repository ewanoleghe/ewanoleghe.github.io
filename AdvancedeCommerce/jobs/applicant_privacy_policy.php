<p>
	GSI - Genjirō, Inc. (“Company”, “we”, or “us”) values the trust you place in us when you give us
	access to your personal data. We respect the privacy rights of individuals and are committed to
	handling personal information responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws.
</p>

<p>
	The Company is a “data controller” of your personal data (for the purpose of the General Data
	Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and is responsible for the lawfulness of what we do with your
	personal data. These Privacy Policy provisions will apply to our processing of your personal
	information where you apply to a job opening posted directly by us. Where you apply to a job
	opening for our Company through the application process of another source, such as a job board,
	that source may collect and retain your personal information as part of the application process.
	Any use of your personal information by another source shall be in accordance with that source’s
	own Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
	We use Applicant Tracking Software, branded as Genjirō ATS, an online applicant tracking
	tool, as a “data processor” to process personal information on our behalf. Applicant Tracking
	Software is only entitled to process your personal data in accordance with our instructions.
</p>

<p><b>Data Protection Principles</b></p>

<p>Your data will be:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Used lawfully, fairly and in a transparent way.</li>
	<li>
		Collected only for valid purposes that we have clearly explained to you and not used in any way
		that is incompatible with those purposes.
	</li>
	<li>Relevant to the purposes we have told you about and limited only to those purposes.</li>
	<li>Accurate and kept up to date.</li>
	<li>Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about.</li>
	<li>Kept securely.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Security Technology and Practices</b></p>

<p>
	We always transmit and store personal information securely. This prevents potential hackers from
	“tapping” a data conversation. The data security standards we have in place include auditing,
	logging, backups, and safe-guarding data. Our servers are housed in datacenters that are ISO27001
	certified, the highest and most current standard for managing systems and data securely. All
	datacenter facilities are protected by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance,
	intrusion detection systems and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two-factor
	authentication a minimum of two times to access data center floors. We are SOC 2 compliant and
	audited annually by a third party CPA firm.
</p>

<p>
	No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure,
	however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about
	security on our website, you can contact us at
	<a href="mailto:cs@gsi.jpn.com">cs@gsi.jpn.com</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Data Retention</b></p>
<p>Your personal data will be deleted upon receipt of a written request by you to us.</p>

<p><b>Sensitive Personal Information</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>
		As a general rule, during the recruitment process, we try not to collect or process any

		information concerning your health, sex life, or sexual orientation.
	</li>
	<li>
		However, in some circumstances, we may need to collect, or request on a voluntary disclosure
		basis, some Sensitive Personal Information for legitimate recruiting-related purposes. For
		example, information about your racial/ethnic origin, gender and disabilities may be collected
		for the purposes of equal opportunities monitoring, to comply with anti-discrimination laws and
		for government reporting obligations. Any reports prepared for this purpose would not contain
		personal information, i.e., the information would be aggregated and anonymized. Furthermore,
		information about your physical or mental condition may be collected in order to consider
		accommodations we need to make for the recruitment process and/or subsequent job role.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may provide, on a voluntary basis, other Sensitive Personal Information during the
		recruiting process.

	<li>Information provided by recruiting or executive search agencies; and</li>
	<li>
		Information collected from publicly available sources, including any social media platforms you
		use or other information available online.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If you fail to provide personal data when requested, which is necessary for us to consider your
	application (such as evidence of qualifications or work history), we may not be able to process
	your application further. For example, if we require references for this role and you fail to
	provide us with relevant details, we will not be able to take your application further.

<h2>Legal basis for processing your personal information (EEA applicants only)</h2>
<p>
	Under European data protection law, our legal basis for collecting and processing your personal
	information will depend on the information concerned and the context in which we collect it.

	interests or fundamental rights and freedoms); (b) we need the information to comply with
	applicable immigration and/or employment laws and regulations; (c) we need the information to take

	to withdraw or decline your consent at any time. Please note that withdrawing your consent will
	not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it
	affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds
	other than consent.

Low-carbon fuels reduce the carbon intensity, or the level of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to standard fossil-based fuels across their lifecycle. The most common low-carbon fuels are renewable fuels. Gevo is focused on the development and production of mainstream fuels like gasoline and jet fuel using renewable feedstocks that have the potential to lower greenhouse gas emissions at a meaningful scale and enhance agricultural production, including food and other related products.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Gevo Offers You\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFree health, dental, vision, life and disability insurance for employee and family  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e21 days of paid vacation and sick leave\u0026nbsp; plus 10 paid holidays  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e401k contribution plan\u0026nbsp;  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAnnual incentive plan, based on Company performance  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePaid community service time  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDog friendly office  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe part of a smart, high performing, passionate team  \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWork-from-home stipend, if remote\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSalary (for Colorado only)\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur salary ranges are based on national averages.
